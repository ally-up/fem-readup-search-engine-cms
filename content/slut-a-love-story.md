description = "F-FESTIVAL 2025 (F for Fuck the patriarchy)SLUT: A LOVE STORYAnne Marina Fidlerone-woman manifesto of joyous, feminist, sexual exploration. An autobiographical work by a self-identified slutLanguage: English SLUT: A Love Story is a one-woman manifesto of joyous, feminist, sexual exploration. An autobiographical work by a self-identified slut, it examines how lost love, sex work, and technology have shaped that identity. Employing storytelling, dance and audience participation, performer Anne Marina Fidler weaves a tale that is funny, dynamic and sincere. She uses her rich and charmed sexual history as a base from which the audience is invited to participate in a narrative that celebrates the complexities of sex as part of our fully realised selves, while still acknowledging the collective trauma and shame that patriarchy places on sexuality.Who is Anne Fidler?Anne Fidler is a multidisciplinary performance artist whose work explores vulnerability, sexuality, co-creation, and failure. With a background in cabaret and drag, as well as costume design for theater, she brings a distinctive sensibility to her performances. Anne trained in London and completed an MA in Performance Practices at ArtEZ University in 2022. She has been an active member of the Berlin independent performing arts scene since 2017, working as a performer and costume designer. Her first feature-length solo show, 'SLUT: A Love Story,' was featured at the Erotifakton festival in Malmo in 2022 and at the English Theater Berlin in 2024. Her recent work, 'Remedies Against Panic,' integrates polyvagal practices, and audience participation to explore a post-capitalist narrative and premiered at Berliner Ringtheater in 2023 and Arena Festival in Erlangen in 2024."
