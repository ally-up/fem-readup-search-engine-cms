Her research interests span visual culture, (feminist) epistemology, and environmental humanities at large, and pay particular attention to the project of Soviet modernity with its ideological and material implications in spaces, bodies, and lands. She co-authored ‘Geocinema’—a collaborative project that explored the possibilities of a “planetary” notion of cinema. 'Geocinema' has been nominated for the Schering Stiftung Award for Artistic Research (2020), and the Golden Key prize at the Kassel film festival (2021). She holds master's degrees in art history from the City University of New York and analytical chemistry from the Kyiv National University. An event in the framework of Making Spaces: A Programming Series in Solidarity with Ukraine, funded by the Kuratorium Preußischer Kulturbesitz.
