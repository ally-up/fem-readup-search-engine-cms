description = "F-Festival 2025 (F for Fuck the patriarchy)Trigger Warning: The workshop may include references to sensitive topics such as trauma, gender-based violence, and social oppression.The Personal is Political: Feminist Practices of Working With DiariesVika PrivalovaWorkshopLanguage: EnglishThe workshop lasts 2 hours with two short breaks.Group/Participants: Concept and Host: Vika Privalova (theatre-maker and multidisciplinary artist). Participants and Authors: Aisylu Chanysheva, Diana Meyerhold.Diaries have long served as private spaces for reflection and self-exploration. However, The Personal is Political explores how these deeply personal narratives can transform into powerful political statements. Through a feminist lens, the interactive workshop examines how intimate experiences—often dismissed as apolitical—are intrinsically linked to broader social and political structures. This project contributes to the ongoing feminist discourse and creating space for voices that challenge societal norms through personal storytelling."
