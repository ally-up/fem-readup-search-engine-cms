description = "The session is a multi-sensory workshop focusing on legal resources, somatic therapy, healing historical trauma, collective readings and ancestral healing as tools of protection against domestic violence notably within queer relationships.Focusing on radical black feminist queer practices through activism and transformational justice, we will focus on short readings from Semra Ertan, Carmen Maria Machado and Bell Hooks to introduce trauma-informed healing bodies as tools against institutional and domestic abuse within queer migrant affected communities focusing on race relations.Artistic sonic, film and print material from International Women* Space and Nyabinghi Lab introduce voices from black feminist resistance movements through drawing therapy. We discover what are safe and consensual exchanges, releasing trauma from our bodies; processing grief and trauma bond; tools to safely exit spaces of coercive control; somatic expression and voice; somatic tools for self-care and protection rituals for growth.The workshop invites special guests and is part of an ongoing series in collaboration with Nyabinghi Lab, International Women’s Space and WeAreBornFree Empowerment Radio. As part of the session, a donation will be sent to the organisation Women In Exile because community is anchored in mutual respect, support, acknowledgment and solidarity. **If you have been affected by domestic violence psychological and physical, please seek support through our platform** Instagramlinks:  Anguezomo Mba Bikoro hereNyabinghi Lab hereWhen The Jackal Leaves The Sun here If you want to take part in the workshop please register under workshops (at) ausland.berlin until the 4.12.23"
