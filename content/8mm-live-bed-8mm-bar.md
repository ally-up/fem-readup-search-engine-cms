description = "8MM Live: BED BED is a Berlin based band founded by Argentinian bass player Sol Astolfi and Chilean vocalist Nicolás Astorga in 2021. After initial experimentation and writing sessions, they invited German guitarist Ema Schiller to join. At its core, BED is a queer musical project, with a sound rooted in shoegaze, dream pop and post punk. Since autumn 2024, multidisciplinary artist Eylül Deniz (Sunfear) joins the band on guitar. BED‘s lyrics are sad and sexual, weaving together threads of both vulnerability and desire, producing a body of work that challenges normative creative expression. This is exemplified in the vocalizations, which are intentionally gender ambiguous, representing a fluid identity throughout the album. Inspired by musicians such as Liz Harris (Grouper), Kevin Shields (My Bloody Valentine), Elizabeth Fraser (Cocteau Twins), Courtney Love (Hole) and Bowery Electric, the band winds together iconic elements of the 90s scene, layered with ambient and influenced by the Berlin rave scene.
