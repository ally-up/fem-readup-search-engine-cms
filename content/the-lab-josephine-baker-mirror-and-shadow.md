title = "The Lab: Josephine Baker - Mirror and Shadow"
description = "Josephine Baker - Mirror And Shadow - explores a symbolic connection between Josephine Baker (1906-1975) and Étoile Chaville (1982-). Both artists are afro descendant, dancer-singers and have the French citizenship. However, seventy-six years separate them and their lives unfold in very different socio-economic contexts. What connect them? Which struggles had to be overcome in Josephine Baker’s time and are still relevant today for women who don’t fit in a box? Built as a dialogue between past and present, Josephine Baker - Mirror And Shadow - questions stereotyped images, around races, gender or sexuality and their influence on our vision of the world and the Other.THE LAB is the artist and audience development series at ETB | IPAC. Founded by Daniel Brunet in 2003, it offers Berlin-based artists an opportunity to share their work-in-progress with an audience and receive feedback in the form of a post-performance discussion."
