description = "Trigger Warning: Violences – Sexual abuses – RacismBy: Maïmouna CoulibalyLanguage: EnglishProgram:Hot Pussy Show Talk Booty Therapy InitiationHot Pussy Show (60 minutes)Adapted from her book Je me relève (2021, published by Anne Carrière), this hard-hitting one-woman show written by Maïmouna and directed by Gilles Ramade combines theatre, stand-up, song and dance, personal and political commitment.This show is a way of letting off steam, a way of letting go of traumas, understanding them, living them together to develop a form of resilience and move beyond them. The voice and the body merge, becoming a means of empowerment. It's a remedy, a cure and a therapy all rolled into one, with people shouting, crying and laughing, and no one leaves indifferent. Maïmouna tells her story with accuracy and power, liberating words and bodies with delicacy and sincerity.For once, the floor is given to women and gender minorities, who testify to their experiences of intersectional violence with humour and pride. Throughout the show, Maïmouna tackles taboo subjects: rape, sexual assault, female masturbation, body positivism, female circumcision and motherhood.Director: Gilles RamadePerformer: Maïmouna CoulibalyTalk (30 minutes)Right after the performance Maïmouna will be available to speak with you about the main thematics of the performance.
