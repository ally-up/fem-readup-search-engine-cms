description = "“A world without trans people has never existed and never will.” From June 21 to 23, Trans/generations transforms Berliner Ringtheater into a space for community building across generations of transgender existence. Hosted by a team of trans and genderqueer performing artists (elena rose light with Cristina Leoni-Osion, Alice Nogueira, and Jäckie Rydz), the three-day performance/workshop emphasizes body-based practices and ritual for connecting with trans life—past, present, and future. We will build an altar for our trans-cestors, engage in somatic practices for surviving our political present, and dream up speculative fictions for our futures. People of all gender identities, ages, and backgrounds are invited to join us in centering trans people and practices throughout the weekend. Friday, June 21, 19h - 22h Saturday, June 22, 14h - 18h Sunday, June 23, 14h - 18h FREE ticket reservation needed for each day Suggested donation per day: 5-20 EUR"
