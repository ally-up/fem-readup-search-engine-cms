description = "Power tools and Power dynamics: in this two-day bi-lingual workshop, we learn how to build, drill, saw and nail - both wood, metal and the patriarchy. Whether you're a performer, a stage designer, a technician or just thriving for more creativity and independence, this workshop offers a safer yet playful environment for learning, building, DIYing.Aside from building, we'll talk about means of coping as  flinta* people in working and construction spaces, safety and tools for both hands and minds."
