description = "SAVVY MEETS PARANORMA - OTNIEL TASMAN  FRIENDS Contemporary Lengger OTNIEL TASMAN Young choreographer and a Lengger (a cross-gender traditional art practitioner belonging to the Banyumas tradition). Committed to voicing gender justice and exploring the wisdom of the Lengger tradition, which has fluid gender values that align with the philosophy and spirituality of life in the Banyumas tradition. In addition to choreographing dance works both with traditional and contemporary approaches, I initiated the Jagad Lengger Festival as a socio-cultural choreographic practice to nurture, advance, and excavate the wisdom of the Banyumas Lengger tradition, as well as produce and promote local knowledge that lives and is lived by the Banyumas Lengger community. The book Lengger is my Religion, which I wrote in 2020-2021 and launched in 2021, is one of my efforts to share my experience of living life as a Lengger and to dialogue with the public about the body, gender, tradition and spirituality."
