description = "You are warmly invited to witness a unique transdisciplinary performance involving movement, sound, spoken word, image and glass structures. The play will be followed by a QA session with the artists.Chaos, in this order tells the story of three queer, late-identified autistic artists exploring their ever-changing sense of identity and the masks they use to belong. It questions our sense of perception: below the layers of forced conformity, who are they really? The play underlines the lack of spaces in which to feel truly safe and the thin thread that binds us all to a world dictating what we are granted or denied.the 8th place collective:Our collective was born upon the realisation that our combined perceptions, audiences and variety of crafts could be united to better fulfill our mission of adding to the sorely lacking FLINTA* autistic representation. Relatable experiences are often the first step of an identification journey that could lead to information, culture, community and care. We are proud of opening well-needed conversations among non-autistic and intersectional feminist allies, and of affirming that marginalized and disabled artists deserve autonomy, paid working opportunities and accessible working environments.Â accessibility information:There will be communication assistance for deaf people and Audio Description.We try make make the space fragrance-free.
