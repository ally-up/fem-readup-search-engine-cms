description = "What was the role of women's and lesbian groups during the so-called 'fall' of 1989? How did Marie Jalowicz Simon, a German Jew, react to the assassination attempt on Adolf Hitler on the 20th of July 1944? What did women fight for in the March Revolution of 1848/49? The themed tour looks at selected moments in 19th and 20th century German history in the exhibition “Roads not Taken. Or: Things could have turned out differently”, focusing on feminist and gender-historical perspectives. In line with the exhibition, we also pose the question: could things have turned out differently?"
